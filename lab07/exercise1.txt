Scenario 1
    1. [cache size], [array size]
    2. 0
    3. [Array size], [32]
	[step size], [1]


Scenario 2
    1. 2
    2. MH
    3. 1

Scenario 3
    1. [0.5] [0.0] [0.5]
    2. We have 32 accesses to L1 cache in total. 16 of them are missed.
    3.We have 16 accesses to L2 cache in total. They are the missed accesses to L1 cache.
    4. [Rep Count]
	重复遍历多次后，L2 会在第一次遍历时把所有 16 块装满，后续的每个 L1 miss（共 16 次/遍）都会 hit L2
    5. (1) it has no effect on the L1_HR and L2_HR when we increase the number of blocks in L1. (2) the L1_HR will increase when we increase the block size of L1 cache, but the L2_HR will not be affected
